AOTExportSeparated
==================

Small project for Dynamics AX 2009, which allows exporting an AOT node and
its children into separate XPO files.


Installation
============

Just import the two XPO files. If you want to invoke this export
functionality from the AOT context menu, you could insert the imported menu
item into the menu SysContextMenu.
