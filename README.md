AOTExportSeparated
==================

Small project for Dynamics AX 2009, which allows exporting an AOT node and
its children into separate XPO files sorted by element type.
This is useful for interacting with VCS such as SVN or Git. This repository
is an example of such an export.


Installation
============

Just import the two XPO files. If you want to invoke this export
functionality from the AOT context menu, you could insert the imported menu
item into the menu SysContextMenu.
